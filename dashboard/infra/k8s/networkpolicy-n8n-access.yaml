# NetworkPolicy: Allow ops-dashboard to access n8n
# Feature: 010-dashboard-observability
# Purpose: Permit HTTP traffic from ops-dashboard pods to n8n on TCP 5678
#
# NOTE: This policy must be deployed to the n8n-prod namespace
# because NetworkPolicy ingress rules only affect pods in the same namespace
# as the policy.
