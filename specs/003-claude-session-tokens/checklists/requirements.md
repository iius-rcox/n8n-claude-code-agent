- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`
- All 8 functional requirements are testable
- 3 user stories with 9 acceptance scenarios total
- 5 edge cases documented with expected behavior
- No dependencies on other sprints (S3 is independent)
- Output (secret YAML) will be consumed by Sprint 5
